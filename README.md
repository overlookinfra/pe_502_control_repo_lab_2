# A Puppet Control Repository

# Code Comparison Feature Branch

THIS BRANCH IS FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY!

This branch provides a Puppet vs RSpec-Puppet code example
in the `site_modules/profile` module.

See

    site_modules/profile/manifests/server.pp
  
and

    site_modules/profile/spec/classes/server_spec.rb

for the code examples.



# PE 502 Starting Point

This control repo supports Lab 2 in the [Puppet Enterprise 502](https://www.puppet.com/support/training) training course.

Control repositories used directly in labs can use this control repo to get started, and 
then have their own modifications added to the code in order to progress the labs in a
stepwise fashion.
